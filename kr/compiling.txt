Why `floor` doesn't work / program won't compile?

08:27:36  Fernando-Basso | Why do we use -lm (at least with gcc) to link math lib, but not for stdio for
                         | example?
08:33:23            kate | Fernando-Basso: just convenience. you can have your compiler not tell the
                         | linker to link -lc, too. i think a better question is why are libm and libc
                         | separate on those systems?


The important option you missed is -lm.  The floor function is in the
math library, and -lm says to link the math library code in with your
program.  (#include <math.h> isn't enough; that tells the compiler
things like what parameter types it takes and what it returns, but
doesn't include the actual code for the function.

This is what the line in the man page (`man 3 floor`)

       Link with -lm.

means.

The other options he used tighten down the error and warning reporting
to better capture any errors in the code.
