** 1.8 Arguments - Call (pass) By Value

Function arguments are passed by value. A variable passed to a
function is a copy. The function can change the value but the original
variable outside that function is unchanged.

When arrays are passed to a function, then they are like pointers and
you can change the array inside the function and the change is
reflected in the array outside that function. We can say arrays are
_always_ passed by reference; they are pointers.
